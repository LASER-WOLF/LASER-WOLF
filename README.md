Heello hello & welcome to GitHub profile ✨ ✨

My name is Casper & I'm currently hard at work expanding my mind palace with wonderful knowledge of mind-boggling computer science teachings and bewildering mathematical equations. 

My main fields of interest are in the dark arts of video game development and 3D graphics programming.

I'm currently attending a backend course in C# and working on a [3D roguelike project](https://github.com/LASER-WOLF/Roguelike).

Apart from the forementioned interest in the realm of computers and such things I'm also quite into other stuff too like [the noble art of film](https://letterboxd.com/LASER_WOLF/), and devoted to joyous past-time activites such as mountain biking and sailing.
